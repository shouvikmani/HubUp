# HubUp
HubUp is a web application that lets users create, manage, and discover public events. By removing the network constraints of traditional social networks, HubUp makes it easy to find events, meet new people, and expand your social network. 

Technologies: HubUp is powered by a Django back end, Google Maps API, and Bootstrap.
